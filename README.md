# Obsidian Baseline

This repository defines the baseline structure, configuration, and plugins
for derived Obsidian vaults.

It is not a daily-use vault.

Changes to this repository are intentional, infrequent, and forward-looking.
They exist to improve future vaults, not to retrofit existing ones.

Copy `data.json.template` to `data.json` and fill in the security key locally.
